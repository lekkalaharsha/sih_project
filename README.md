 Electrical power system is one of the most complex and advanced systems in the world. The energy management of such a system from the point of generation and distribution has been optimized but the demand side has only received attention in the last decade. This has led to the implementation of demand side management (DSM) which involves a number of different methods to improve the power system at the demand side. DSM ranges from increasing load efficiency by using better materials to implementing smart energy tariffs for different consumption patterns, up to using sophisticated systems to control distributed energy sources.

Data Acquisition Code And Detail Explanation
Data Acquisition By Using Nodemcu And Sensor
As EV vehicles are becoming more popular increasing their charging needs are also increasing. it is leading to affect the grid system .To maintain both grids and also provide the best facilities for the EV  
For this, we have to monitor the transformation of local to control the condition 
Data gathering for machine learning
We get the transformer data by using ct and pt. 
We calculate power from the transformer 
This data is sent to the google sheet through nodemcu (esp8266)
After gathering the data , the data will be stored up to 6 months.
